## [INTRODUCTION](#introduction)
Partied a little too hard and need a ride home for both you and your car? Don't worry, we've got you covered. At HOMEZ, we understand that a great night out sometimes means you're not in the best condition to drive home. That's why we're here. With our easy to navigate website, you can book a ride with your HOMEZ. We'll send two drivers: one to drive you home in your own car, and another to pick up your driver. No more stressing about leaving your car overnight or bothering friends for a ride back to it the next day. With HOMEZ, you can enjoy your night to the fullest and still make it home safe and sound. We've got your back... and your car's too.

HOMEZ pairs riders with two drivers: One to take them home, and one to take their car home. Think of it as a ride share service with the extra convenience of taking your car home while getting you home safely. Such services are commonplace in countries like South Korea and Japan, so we thought that we'd bring you a similar service here in the States!

HOMEZ runs on a MERN framework and can be run on the command line through node.js and express.js.
